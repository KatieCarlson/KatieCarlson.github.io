                My seven minute documentary was played at Gregory's Gala in front of an audience of 200 people.  The Gala was a fundraiser for a Pittsburgh non-profic organization called Gregory's Gift that gives matching grants and loans to families looking to adopt.  The video highlights the impact that the organization has had already.

                Process
            </h2>
            <p>
                In the months leading up to gala fundraiser, I worked together with the social media team and marketing director to create promotional videos.  In one video, I interview the founder of the organization and created moving infographics in Adobe After Effects that illustrated the adoption statistics that we wanted to display.  Another video I made told the story of how the organization 'Gregory's Gift' was started, through the eyes of a ten-year old boy that was writing a letter and thanking the person that helped fund his adoption seven years ago.
            </p>
            <h6 style="background-color:#eaf4f5;padding:6px">
                I created these videos myself from start to finish.  The timeframe and scope of the project allowed me to gain experience interviewing, planning, filming, editing, and creating graphics, and I enjoyed the creative control I had over each video.
            </h6>
            <p>
                The creation of the documentary happened across a few months.  I communicated with the families that had partnered with the Gregory's Gift adoption organization, and set-up a location and a date to interview the parents and film b-roll of the family interacting.  My mom came with me for these shoots so that I could run two cameras
            </p>
            <p>
                I took all of the interview footage, a few more infographics that I created, and the b-roll that I filmed in order to create an emotionally moving, and visually stunning documentary.   
            </p>
            <h6 style="background-color:#eaf4f5;padding:6px">
                This was the largest project I had ever completed.  We filmed four different family stories, posted the videos on a platform that reached hundreds of people, and helped raise $50,000 for adoption.
            </h6>
            <p>
                Since this project was also my senior project, I presented it to a small panel and explained my process and what I gained from working on the project.
