            <p>
                During my Freshmen year, I worked for the Ivan Allen College of Liberal Arts under the FRIP program.  We were told to conduct in research in whatever field we chose, and I decided to study filmmaking.  I realized that, as a result of my indepent approach to creating videos, there were significant gaps in my knowledge of producing large-scale film projects.  So I spent Freshmen year learning about the pre-production stage of filmmaking.

                <i>Caption: this is the "kickstarter" video I created to introduce my film in an engaging way.</i>

                Production
            </h2>
            <p>
                I wrote the script, and created mood boards for certain characters and settings to help create a vision for the story I was trying to tell.  The storyboard I drew out, while lacking in artist finesse, captures my ideas for what I want the audience to see, frame by frame, camera angle by camera angle.

                Until the end of Freshmen year, I had been the sole contributor to this project.  Now I am faced with the challenge of recruiting a production team.  Film shoots require a crew, and producing a film requires a variety of skillsets.

            <p>
                I am still in the process of producing this film.  I plan to be done with filming by December of 2019, and I want to work on editing and finalizing the film in the first few months of the following semester.
